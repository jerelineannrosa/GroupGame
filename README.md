Shadow Labyrinth is a minimalist horror maze game where the player must escape a dark labyrinth using only brief moments of light. The maze is mostly hidden in darkness, and the player can only see their current position, creating tension and uncertainty with every move.

The player controls a glowing character using the arrow keys and must carefully navigate through open paths while avoiding walls. Hitting a wall instantly resets the player back to the starting point and triggers a red jumpscare screen, adding a horror element to the gameplay.

Every few seconds, the maze briefly "lights up," revealing the walls, paths, and the exit. This short glimpse acts like an echo or memory, challenging the player to remember the maze layout once darkness returns. The maze layout also changes during these light-up moments, making each escape attempt unpredictable.

The goal of the game is to reach the green exit tile without crashing into walls. Success requires focus, memory, and careful movement, blending puzzle-solving with psychological horror in a simple but intense experience.
